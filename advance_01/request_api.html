    //fetch Api was launched only ~5 yr ago...earlier we used XMLHttpRequest...its used heavily in AJAX Programming
    //Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.


    const requestUrl = 'https://api.github.com/users/hiteshchoudhary'
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();//xhr is just a variable u can name it anything
    xhr.open('GET', requestUrl)
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function(){
        console.log(xhr.readyState);
        if (xhr.readyState === 4) {
            const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText)//...Object bana diya string ko ...Current context ki baat ho rhi isliye 'this' ka use kiya.
            console.log(typeof data);//ye string hai...object nhi
            console.log(data.followers);
        }
