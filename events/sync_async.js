//JS is a Sync language,single threaded

//in executiom conetxt...we execute one line at a time

//Blocking code==>block the flow of program/tum khadde raho me ani leke aata hu....Read file sync

//Non Blocking code ==>does not blocl execution/Tum pjone chalao ...mai aata hu pani leke......read file sync

//BOTH METHODS ARE GOOD BASED ON YOUR USE CASE
